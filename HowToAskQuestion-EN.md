## **How to ask questions**
***


In order to reduce communication costs, to help you solve the problem directly, please read the wiki before asking to help you ask better questions, solve problems more quickly and efficiently.

I hope the 80% of the time spent solving problems, rather than a question and answer on the Q & A, is really a waste of time. If we are wasting people's time, how others take the time to help you solve the problem? With people easily, your own convenience.

If you are a developer, ready to watch SRS code, ready to change something, then the following "Developer Notes" is what you want to see in detail.

If you are a user, simply run the SRS, or need to find a bug report bug, then see "User Information" just fine.


## **Community Code**
***


Some basic rules:

Do not ask me a single question asked in the group. The reason is simple: First, many Azeri population, both alone and asked me if I was going to die. Second, most of the questions are repetitive, they might ask someone else in the group knows. Third, I hope SRS form communities, communities can help each other. Of course, if there are special circumstances may be an exception.
Do not ask open-ended questions, ask closed questions. This is all a question of principle, for example, do not ask SRS okay? What RTMP is? To ask specific questions: RTMP is extended timestamp, the head of the c3 will send it?
Before asking questions over again wiki, basically all have the answer your question in the wiki, does it have to find someone to help you wiki link it?


## **Developers Conditions**
***

SRS group and mailing list, not the teacher's blackboard and students raise the question, 80% of the questions do not deserve answers, as 80% of the problems are "looking at the code." Do not show their childish and lazy, to get their own problems, why should someone else do it?

Do not ask abstract questions, such as how to achieve SRS RTMP? How the HLS stream? How to handle concurrency? How to thread synchronization?
Asked very specific questions, such as how to deal with the timestamp ts do not ask, but asking: xxx first line of code to calculate pts = dts + cts, cts whether the timestamp rtmp package? Of course, this problem can be understood under the debugger.
Do not generalities to ask questions, read the README, read WIKI, own debugging code, and then ask questions. Only allow the developer to ask specific questions.
