**How to ask questions**

In order to reduce communication costs, to help you solve the problem directly, please read the wiki before asking to help you ask better questions, solve problems more quickly and efficiently.

If you are a developer, ready to watch SRS code, ready to change something, then the following "Developer Notes" is what you want to see in detail.

If you are a user, simply run the SRS, or need to find a bug report bug, then see "User Information" just fine.
